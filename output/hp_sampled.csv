639,harry,"Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
966,harry,Knight to E-5.
1549,harry,Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.

249,harry,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?"
266,hermione,Harry.
1554,dumbledore,"Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. "
735,hermione,Finite Incantatem!
618,snape,However the circumstances are suspicious.
990,snape,Turn out your pockets.
356,harry,We need to find the train.
1600,harry,"You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain..."
1427,harry,Hermione that's the he betrayed my parents.
241,hermione,Professor R.J. Lupin.
21,harry,Okay.
712,hermione,"After he saved you, he sent them off."
1128,hermione,I thought I just saw...Never mind.
680,hermione,He'd kill his best friend.
687,hermione,If you're talking about Malfoy...
72,harry,I never knew my parents either.
707,harry,What happened?
477,hermione,I hear Draco's father's furious.
122,harry,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
1369,harry,She died in a bathroom?
1352,hermione,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius."
361,harry,Excuse me. Excuse me.
1542,dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love. "
977,hermione,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
401,snape,As it is...
235,hermione,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny."
1197,harry,You're the reason they're dead!
428,hermione,"Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me."
950,harry,"You don't think it was me, professor?"
1581,dumbledore,Good night.
874,harry,He was their friend!
569,harry,That voice.
109,harry,Ron! Fred. George. 
1421,hermione,Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
1436,hermione,Why aren't we leaving?
754,harry,What's this rubbish?
574,harry,It's moving.
1694,hermione,"Oh, no."
584,snape,And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
651,snape,Any theories on how he managed it?
1109,harry,It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
1574,harry,"Ginny, you need to get yourself out."
980,hermione,Cheers.
1527,harry,It'll just be me and him.
1408,harry,You're running away?
1153,hermione,It had to be a Gryffindor.
1518,harry,It was my dad conjured the Patronus.
649,snape,To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?
1533,harry,"In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready."
1204,dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid."
1157,harry,And they found it.
271,harry,What was that thing that came?
386,hermione,Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.
1568,dumbledore,I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.
1503,hermione,Look. It's Lupin.
822,hermione,Help! Help!
1087,harry,Are you Tom Riddle?
939,dumbledore,Their tears have healing powers.
1181,hermione,He's a werewolf!
666,snape,Turn to page 394.
623,hermione,We'd just found him when he said...
627,dumbledore,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
656,snape,What about Potter?
922,harry,I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
1445,hermione,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
1083,harry,Malfoy.
1008,snape,Supposed to be your area of expertise.
939,hermione,That thing has a name?
837,hermione,So rude.
1573,harry,Don't worry.
1486,harry,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
595,snape,"As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite."
1686,hermione,Congratulations.
315,harry,I know you do.
583,hermione,"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
1442,harry,What?
1089,dumbledore,Riddle! Come.
1230,hermione,You attacked a teacher!
4,harry,Now you’ve done it.
1228,harry,Expelliarmus!
1131,harry,"Oh, no."
1398,harry,This is not normal.
857,snape,We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
273,harry,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
668,hermione,"Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks."
1190,harry,What's that for?
873,harry,He was their friend and he betrayed them.
606,harry,Can I borrow this? Thanks.
1586,harry,I don't know.
720,hermione,Alohomora
1599,harry,It's just...
1195,harry,I know why.
1615,dumbledore,Which makes you different from Voldemort.
1044,hermione,Do you mind me trying?
523,harry,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
110,harry,What are you all doing here?
1037,harry,It's just what I saw.
396,harry,We'll take the lot.
1620,harry,Godric Gryffindor.
530,harry,That's horrible.
1585,hermione,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
926,harry,You're wrong.
16,dumbledore,"Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?"
613,harry,"It's not true, sir. I swear."
1294,harry,"No. Don't worry, okay?"
921,harry,It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
392,snape,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
1104,dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
987,harry,You need to sound more like Crabbe.
617,snape,Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
602,harry,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
250,harry,I haven't any money.
964,hermione,"Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms."
1543,dumbledore,Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. 
625,dumbledore,Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
1435,harry,Just like that? How?
42,harry,You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
1559,harry,Does that make sense?
634,hermione,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
611,harry,Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
74,harry,Keep away from me.
261,harry,Maybe we've broken down.
585,harry,"Oh, no."
1162,harry,The dog. Where is it?
834,hermione,Harry!
600,dumbledore,"Argus, I..."
1630,hermione,This came with it.
967,hermione,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
1579,harry,He's free. We did it.
684,hermione,"The question is, who is it?"
707,hermione,Yes 
1397,harry,"Professor, we have some information for you."
350,harry,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
513,harry,He'll know what to do.
173,hermione,That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
170,hermione,It's in his nature.
8,dumbledore,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
1687,hermione,I can't believe you solved it.
825,hermione,Moaning Myrtle.
798,harry,Where's Hermione?
388,harry,I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
226,harry,And kill me.
1554,harry,Expecto Patronum!
1335,harry,Now more than ever.
897,hermione,"Harry, listen to me."
1535,harry,Thanks.
1149,harry,Come on!
1241,dumbledore,"Calm yourself, Hagrid."
671,hermione,Muggle-borns.
1414,harry,You're a fraud.
1613,harry,Because I asked it to.
703,hermione,Here it is.
240,harry,"But why am I famous, Hagrid?"
1334,harry,We need you.
1439,hermione,Sorry.
20,dumbledore,The only family he has.
162,harry,"I mean, I'm just Harry."
403,harry,Professor Dumbledore.
766,harry,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
1045,hermione,"The Grim, possibly."
1346,harry,Expecto Patronum!
933,dumbledore,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
687,snape,"As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it."
285,harry,Hello?
277,harry,What happened to me?
360,harry,Do you hear that?
76,harry,Anytime.
693,snape,There are several ways to become a werewolf.
1310,harry,Arania Exumai!
508,hermione,"You okay, Ron?"
1517,harry,It was my dad.
1082,harry,Why don't we just set him free?
1699,harry,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
1382,snape,Your moment has come at last.
155,harry,But what's he got to do with me?
1196,harry,You betrayed my parents.
287,dumbledore,Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
447,harry,"Hey, Hagrid."
1129,harry,It was Hagrid. 
301,harry,And who owned that wand?
1491,dumbledore,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister."
938,dumbledore,They can carry immensely heavy loads.
869,hermione,"Ron, look!"
741,harry,"No, Not you."
236,hermione,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
1501,harry,How?
1416,hermione,Of course.
1258,harry,"Come on, Fang."
1184,harry,I can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
1671,harry,Just promise me something.
884,harry,I bet loads of people here can do it.
870,hermione,"Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me."
986,harry,We still sound like ourselves.
1685,hermione,It's good to be back.
1136,harry,What would any of us have done?
993,harry,"Hermione, are you okay?"
154,harry,"Sirius Black, you mean?"
680,hermione,McGonagall's worried. 
1451,hermione,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
630,hermione,Up. Up. Up!
1338,harry,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
1010,harry,Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
48,harry,"Dobby, shh!"
37,harry,Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
920,harry,"Well, it is."
39,harry,"I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything."
1528,dumbledore,"But yes, he will die."
348,harry,We've missed it.
27,dumbledore,"It's not really goodbye, after all."
1038,harry,Thats my dad
284,harry,But someone was screaming.
795,harry,"Stop it, Dobby!"
1281,harry,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
619,snape,"I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
963,hermione,"Simple, but powerful."
1151,hermione,Duck!
355,harry,"Come on, then. Let's go lower."
551,harry,I think she fancies you.
1463,dumbledore,Look beyond the rocks.
1543,harry,My dad will come.
982,harry,Mischief managed. Nox.
969,hermione,I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
202,harry,Mr. Weasley.
1511,hermione,Yeah?
48,harry,My dad wasn't a drunk.
1298,harry,"Well, thank you."
939,harry,But it's the best I have.
359,harry,"There's no such thing, is there?"
210,harry,"Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?"
399,snape,"I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... "
1020,harry,You're wrong!
291,hermione,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
1184,hermione,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
1055,hermione,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
1500,hermione,We save Sirius.
647,dumbledore,I didn't really expect him to linger.
1555,harry,"You were right, Hermione."
1095,hermione,I think you owe someone an apology.
1157,harry,I just hope I'm wrong.
675,snape,How disappointing.
503,hermione,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
989,harry,"If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
1154,harry,Don't worry.
166,harry,"Dear Mr. Potter,"
1053,harry,Hermione?
440,hermione,Did you know?
162,harry,Hedwig.
1430,hermione,"Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now."
1347,hermione,Harry?
1689,harry,We couldn't have done it without you.
983,snape,Potter.
407,dumbledore,I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.
876,snape,Vipera Evanesca.
1602,dumbledore,I see.
683,hermione,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. 
1551,dumbledore,Another year gone. 
1271,harry,Don't panic.
478,hermione,It's just bewitched to look like the night sky.
253,hermione,"I mean, everyone's looking for him."
1493,dumbledore,"Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required."
1222,snape,They're so longing to see you.
1066,hermione,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
1220,snape,"I could do it, you know."
1360,harry,It's true sir. Sirius is innocent.
676,hermione,"Please, sir."
1566,hermione,We're tied with Slytherin!
952,dumbledore,But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
1547,harry,"All right there, Ron?"
1487,harry,I'll go on and find Ginny.
638,dumbledore,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch."
1542,harry,Don't worry.
379,hermione,"Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
657,snape,Should he be warned?
1376,hermione,Lumus Solem!
1607,dumbledore,Not intentionally but yes.
212,harry,Diagonally.
1414,harry,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
1310,harry,I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
1506,harry,And now we wait.
496,harry,Malfoy?
654,hermione,Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
474,harry,"I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
422,hermione,"Oh, are you doing magic?"
729,harry,I need to know how to fight them.
573,snape,There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class.
1532,dumbledore,That is one of my more brilliant ideas. 
716,harry,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
67,harry,"I mean, do you talk to people often?"
1160,harry,Ron.
1602,harry,Pettigrew escaped.
961,hermione,I've got it all worked out.
1479,dumbledore,How extraordinary.
579,harry,I've never seen spiders act like that.
1101,dumbledore,"No, minister. Over this way."
861,hermione,"Ron's right, Harry. "
1374,hermione,"Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! "
1643,dumbledore,The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
1581,harry,"It's all right, Ginny."
1318,harry,Come on!
1594,dumbledore,"Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry."
612,harry,Listen.
1195,harry,Did you hear about Hermione?
575,snape,"However, for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses."
944,dumbledore,Hagriiid!! Relax.
1619,dumbledore,Be careful.
1334,harry,Snoring
693,harry,"I mean, look at his family."
1422,hermione,"Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
937,harry,That's the memory I chose.
73,harry,"Mummy, Dad, come here! "
1621,dumbledore,It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
1523,harry,You see Sirius talking to me there?
1651,harry,I have something of yours.
372,harry,Up! Up!
1433,hermione,We can't be seen.
995,snape,Reveal your secrets.
1102,dumbledore,Is there something you wish to tell me?
1555,dumbledore,"In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points"
84,harry,I fell over.
387,harry,we almost get killed by a tree...
953,harry,"No, sir. Nothing"
1242,dumbledore,"If the governors desire my removal I will, of course, step aside."
1552,dumbledore,"And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. "
306,dumbledore,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
1527,dumbledore,He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. 
697,hermione,Even they aren't that thick.
815,hermione,He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
1609,harry,I should be in Slytherin.
572,harry,And then again just...
1360,harry,She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
1551,harry,Sirius.
976,harry,"Come on, let's get them."
1274,harry,We're friends of Hagrid's.
525,hermione,Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
898,hermione,There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
566,hermione,Harry!
209,harry,One pair of dragon hide gloves.
1533,dumbledore,And between you and me thats saying something.
62,harry,"He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day..."
1526,harry,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'."
1364,hermione,Are you okay?
427,hermione,"Well, it's not very good, is it?"
1635,harry,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
582,hermione,"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. 
Enemies of the Heir, beware."
1350,harry,He sent the dementors away.
711,hermione,Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
617,hermione,"It's not funny, Ron."
347,harry,The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
1223,snape,Do I detect a flicker of fear?
1340,harry,Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk.
1085,harry,Excuse me. 
363,harry,"Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?"
578,harry,Strange.
679,hermione,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
1587,harry,"Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
247,hermione,Seems to be. Why?
1256,harry,Look.
36,harry,"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
278,harry,I still need... a wand.
905,hermione,He lived a thousand years ago.
1432,hermione,Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time Harry.
1653,harry,"I think you do, sir."
1583,harry,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
1127,harry,HAAGRIIID!
702,hermione,Very dangerous.
444,harry,What?
887,hermione,This is bad.
312,hermione,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
1395,hermione,"You! You foul, loathsome,evil little cockroach!"
1637,harry,Nox.
968,hermione,I got this off her robes.
1588,dumbledore,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
1317,harry,Now!
808,dumbledore,It means that our students are in great danger.
1342,harry,Spiders flee before it.
570,harry,"I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
728,hermione,"No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky."
318,harry,Still doing that after three years.
1027,harry,"Yes, sir."
1164,harry,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. 
163,harry,Just Harry.
806,dumbledore,"Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. "
1280,harry,Get off!
1563,harry,Good job.
1525,hermione,That's great.
659,hermione,What an idiot.
713,hermione,It's forbidden.
926,harry,Expecto Patronum!
256,harry,"Thanks, Ron."
434,hermione,And you are...?
727,harry,"I'm scared, professor."
1522,hermione,Here we come.
987,snape,"He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
418,harry,Yeah.
194,harry,Muggle?
570,harry,We got lost.
1435,hermione,And we aren't leaving?
1452,harry,Buckbeak. Okay?
689,snape,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter."
233,harry,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...I lost control.
1658,harry,Open it.
583,harry,"I don't know, Sir."
637,hermione,and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
1032,harry,"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
660,harry,Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!
521,hermione,He called me a Mudblood.
256,harry,Hang on.
811,hermione,Harry!
589,harry,Seems a pity not to ask her.
499,hermione,They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
1498,harry,"This way, now."
549,harry,That voice.
862,hermione,You're gonna need your strength today.
1539,harry,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
690,hermione,I heard him.
1358,harry,The water.
1234,harry,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
1438,harry,That hurt.
644,dumbledore,Very good.
385,harry,No. Not at all.
584,hermione,It's written in blood.
0,dumbledore,"I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall."
454,harry,"Brilliant, professor."
927,dumbledore,Harry?
1091,harry,I found him!
955,hermione,Didn't.
1425,harry,That's Pettigrew.
1682,hermione,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas."
970,hermione,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
213,harry,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
220,harry,Sorry.
1275,harry,No!
679,hermione,Yes. Couldn't you tell? 
411,harry,"Hey, he's gone!"
1158,hermione,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
1595,dumbledore,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
1311,harry,"Besides, dead, the truth dies with him."
1346,harry,It's a snake.
1146,harry,Ron!
1113,harry, Shh!
731,harry,You made the one on the train go away.
711,hermione,We're not supposed to be here. 
574,snape,"As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making."
1404,hermione,Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
984,harry,Ron.
186,harry,You told me my parents died in a car crash.
421,hermione,"Mandrake, or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state."
639,dumbledore,"The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
498,hermione,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
1536,harry,Great. Now he's coming for us.
1197,harry,"Look, we have to ask you something."
524,hermione,"It means ""dirty blood."
1546,harry,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
394,snape,You have risked the exposure of our world.
547,harry,What?
344,harry,Why can't we get through?
57,harry,Are you all right?
896,hermione,"I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something."
772,harry,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
1297,harry,What?
1592,dumbledore,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban."
1598,dumbledore,"Am I right, Harry?"
791,harry,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
215,harry,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
111,harry,Who is that? That man.
1368,hermione,Please believe us.
177,harry,Egypt. What's it like?
694,snape,They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
1058,harry,Professor Trelawney...
998,snape,Go on.
1063,harry,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
1373,dumbledore,"Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous."
996,harry,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
1165,hermione,"If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!"
148,harry,Thank you.
907,harry,I'll see you back in the common room.
1275,harry,And you?
858,snape,Might I suggest someone from my own house?
26,dumbledore,"There, there, Hagrid."
1231,harry,Tell me about Peter.
295,harry,How did he find out?
380,harry,I don't know.
592,snape,"For your information, Potter"
875,harry,I hope he finds me.
1422,harry,Don't even think about it.
1548,hermione,No one's coming.
1035,harry,Peter Pettigrew.
1138,hermione,Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
801,harry,Who is it?
1148,hermione,Ron!
150,harry,"Excuse me, who are you?"
1572,harry,My mother's eyes.
614,harry,"The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."""
1526,harry,"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
1453,harry,Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
1601,harry,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
669,hermione,We're not meant to start that for weeks.
1639,dumbledore,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
898,harry,Expecto Patronum.
1570,dumbledore,Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
1431,harry,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
1095,harry,I knew the name sound familiar.
305,dumbledore,"Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you."
1065,harry,No. Nothing.
979,harry,Sorry.
1021,harry,"No, sir."
1593,harry,Resigned? Why?
1295,harry,It's fine. I'll stay.
664,snape,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?"
1546,harry,Right there. You'll see.
1553,hermione,Harry!
1133,hermione,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?"
928,harry,I think I've had enough for today.
890,harry,Yes.
36,harry,"Oh, yeah."
1060,harry,She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.
1384,harry,I don't know. 
478,hermione,We haven't heard the end of this.
762,harry,Dobby?
334,harry,Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
446,harry,"Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
1379,dumbledore,If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
258,hermione,We can't be there yet.
705,hermione,"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
23,dumbledore,Exactly.
1465,dumbledore,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
768,harry,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
1577,harry,One minute. 
1374,dumbledore,Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
1610,dumbledore,It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
1134,harry,Ron!
587,snape,"Clearly, fame isn't everything is it, Mr. Potter?"
57,harry,Shut up! Shut up!
1519,hermione,"Harry, but your dad's..."
349,hermione,Me?
267,hermione,"Harry, are you all right?"
436,hermione,Pleasure.
1491,harry,Please wake up.
827,hermione,Moaning Myrtle.
79,harry,I don't care.
1408,hermione,Malfoy's coming.
263,hermione,It's so good to see you.
296,harry,"Sorry, but what's curious?"
616,harry,That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
1518,dumbledore,"Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
1388,hermione,07:30. Where were we at 7:30?
1071,hermione,Pathetic!
579,snape,Our new celebrity.
1077,harry,My name is Harry Potter.
1043,harry,It's his stomachache.
1372,dumbledore,"Mysterious thing, time."
1342,harry,Sirius!
1457,harry,This way.
811,dumbledore,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
691,snape,Page 394.
1225,snape,"It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
1371,dumbledore,"A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen."
673,snape,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?"
1450,hermione,There are more important things. 
1351,harry,I saw him across the lake.
1586,dumbledore,"You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules."
1556,harry,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!
654,dumbledore,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
1206,snape,Vengeance is sweet.
585,harry,Before I fainted I heard something.
286,hermione,"No one was screaming, Harry."
477,hermione,"It's not real, the ceiling. "
1582,harry,It's over.
24,dumbledore,He's far better off growing up away from all of that.
1426,hermione,"Harry, you can't."
1,harry,Lumos Maxima...
381,hermione,A fair few.
1284,harry,Then you're not the monster?
303,dumbledore,Dementors are vicious creatures.
519,dumbledore,Let the feast begin.
228,harry,Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
1278,harry,But we'll take him to the castle.
717,harry,It's locked!
108,harry,"Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
1350,harry,Colin saw it through his camera.
1580,dumbledore,Did what?
648,snape,"Remarkable feat, don't you think?"
1037,harry,"You see them, don't you? "
594,snape,A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
1175,harry,No.
325,harry,Voldemort?
1590,dumbledore,"Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
924,harry,Just do it.
1494,dumbledore,Thank you.
243,harry,"I'm fine, thank you. I was just going..."
439,hermione,"You've got dirt on your nose, by the way."
1603,dumbledore,"Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?"
1289,harry,"But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?"
880,harry,I'm a what?
1444,harry,"Yes, there is."
949,dumbledore,Yes.
56,harry,Please be quiet! 
606,harry,What's going on?
1601,harry,None of it made any difference.
160,harry,"No, you've made a mistake."
1557,harry,I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
29,harry,Who are you?
864,harry,You wish.
1165,harry,He told me so the first time I met him.
1632,dumbledore,Beg your pardon?
596,harry,No. No.
869,harry,Rictusempra!
1485,dumbledore,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
1530,hermione,Harry!
185,harry,Blown up?
255,harry,"I was lost, I..."
683,snape,"That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger."
899,hermione,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
1494,harry,"What do you mean, she won't wake?"
1521,harry,I'm just telling you what I saw.
631,dumbledore,"As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake."
1437,harry,This is it.
1380,dumbledore,"Three turns should do it, I think."
993,harry,Spare bit of parchment.
1361,hermione,Do what I say. Trust me. 
1213,snape,Give me a reason. I beg you!
1524,harry,He's asking me to come live with him.
206,hermione,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
678,hermione,A werewolf has no choice.
1357,hermione,They're going to suck out his soul.
576,snape,I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death.
443,harry,You're doomed.
1611,dumbledore,"Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules."
204,harry,"Yeah, sure."
1339,harry,Come on.
1120,dumbledore,I'd like a cup of tea.
1252,harry,Show me.
1545,dumbledore,But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...
1249,hermione,"You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
919,harry,"It's not happy, exactly."
541,harry,Not really.
1134,hermione,Spells and enchantments.
1009,snape,"Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
1218,snape,"You two, quarrelling like an old married couple."
951,hermione,"Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets!"
1449,hermione,Me? Books and cleverness? 
1313,harry,Arania Exumai!
520,harry,"Well, I don't know exactly what it means."
403,harry,"Shut up, Malfoy."
1612,dumbledore,"Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
1489,harry,"Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead."
1345,harry,No. Sirius!
347,hermione,What a load of rubbish.
1642,dumbledore,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
1113,dumbledore,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
90,harry,Nothing.
890,harry,You were there. You heard me.
999,harry,And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
971,harry,"Ron, maybe I should do it."
609,hermione,"When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something."
1561,hermione,Bombarda!
1548,harry,He'll never be gone. 
1473,harry,This way.
1521,harry,And why did you want to meet me?
1024,harry,Harry Potter?
1326,hermione,Harry!
1006,harry,There was no name. 
586,harry,It's Filch's cat.
1143,harry,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
1369,dumbledore,"I do, Miss Granger."
1396,harry,At least we can tell him what we know.
1512,harry,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone."
1323,harry,Come on! Pull!
1405,hermione,"Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
38,harry,"Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! "
396,snape,that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
665,snape,Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
776,harry,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
397,harry,Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
908,harry,That's one nasty dementor.
1000,snape,You insolent little...
1344,harry,The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
1207,snape,How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
1007,snape,"Take a look, Lupin."
697,hermione,You won't make a fool of yourself. 
484,dumbledore,"Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death."
823,hermione,No. No one ever comes in here.
1549,harry,All right. Hermione?
298,dumbledore,"Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid."
1359,hermione,Just relax!
957,hermione,We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
813,dumbledore,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
1636,harry,Mischief managed.
894,harry,But I didn't realize...
709,hermione,Exactly.
575,harry,I think it's going to kill.
525,harry,What's he teach?
1349,hermione,What?
690,snape,Loss of limb will not excuse you.
558,harry,Spooky.
955,dumbledore,Off you go.
609,dumbledore,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say."
1596,harry,But Dumbledore...
1072,harry,"But who threw it at you, anyway?"
337,harry,What happened to V...?
1576,harry,"You were brilliant, Fawkes."
856,snape,Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
1321,harry,I know.
399,hermione,I think they're funny.
128,harry,Let go of me!
196,harry,It's all upstairs.
1399,hermione,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry."
1056,hermione,It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
992,snape,What's this?
483,dumbledore,"The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students."
763,harry,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that…
362,harry,Hold on.
176,hermione,Harry.
1006,snape,I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
66,harry,Do you...?
1618,dumbledore,If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
1079,hermione,That felt good.
801,hermione,Hope you don't mean yourself.
1542,harry,You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
804,dumbledore,There's been another attack.
1497,harry,This way.
251,harry,Yeah.
1513,harry,That someone made the dementors go away.
945,dumbledore,I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
1577,hermione,We have to go.
1262,harry,Follow the spiders.
577,snape,"Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention."
1402,harry,You mean we've gone back in time?
602,dumbledore,Everyone except you three.
1450,harry,Come with us now. Come on.
1550,hermione,Never better.
1529,harry,He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
1307,harry,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
369,harry,I think we found the train.
99,harry,I didn't.
68,harry,"You're from Burma, aren't you?"
1468,hermione,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
246,harry,Do you think he's really asleep?
509,hermione,Say something.
1081,harry,Can you tell me?
1333,hermione,Harry!
126,harry,Get off!
71,harry,I see. That's me as well.
958,harry,Crabbe and Goyle.
1292,harry,But have you seen it?
3,harry,Lumos... MAXIMA!
761,harry,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
1315,harry,Don't mention it.
1086,harry,Could you tell me what's going on here?
820,hermione,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
1169,hermione,Is that bad?
1248,harry,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
1100,dumbledore,"I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
1654,harry,I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.
920,harry,Professor Dumbledore?
622,hermione,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor."
50,harry,"Dobby, please stop!"
358,harry,This says platform 9 3/4.
101,harry,he Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
786,hermione,Wingardium Leviosa.
1475,dumbledore,All right.
700,hermione,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
753,harry,What are you doing?!
613,harry,"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken."
1547,hermione,"Harry, listen to me."
650,dumbledore,"Quite remarkable, yes."
965,hermione,I don't know.
438,hermione,I expect we'll be arriving soon.
398,snape,Silence.
1237,harry,"The map was lying, then."
1095,dumbledore,"I'm afraid they are, Tom."
288,dumbledore,"Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast."
1333,harry,"Wish you were here, Hermione."
1528,harry,We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
996,snape,Read it.
46,harry,"Stop, Dobby!"
1492,dumbledore,"Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy."
1586,harry,I'm not going home. Not really.
446,harry,"Hey, hey, hey!"
697,dumbledore,Aresto momentum!
511,harry,"Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!"
962,hermione,I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
1407,hermione,Thanks.
431,hermione,"That's better, isn't it?"
997,harry,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
928,harry,Professor.
284,harry,Hello?
46,harry,That's a lie.
1391,harry,Hermione!
674,snape,No one?
1074,hermione,"Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
888,harry,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
714,harry,A month?
818,hermione,Ron fancies her.
814,hermione,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
938,harry,I don't even know if it's real.
1591,harry,You've been sacked.
1348,harry,Because no one did look it in the eye.
1126,harry,Hagrid!
1614,dumbledore,"Exactly, Harry. Exactly."
903,harry,But I'm not.
1428,harry,You don't expect me to sit here.
147,harry,I don't understand.
1532,harry,Let's go.
1622,harry,Dobby.
597,snape,Why aren't you all copying this down?
1583,harry,It's just a memory.
1313,harry,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
388,harry,Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
696,hermione,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
1690,hermione,Thanks.
69,harry,Who’s plotting them?
681,hermione,"Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
626,harry,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
1385,hermione,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
268,harry,Thank you.
61,harry,Sorry about him.
152,harry,"The state of things, sir?"
953,hermione,Did not.
1452,hermione,"And Harry, just be careful."
338,harry,To You-Know-Who?
1200,harry,"Who was it, then?"
87,harry,"I swear, I don't know!"
571,harry,I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
244,hermione,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
635,harry,Strange?
297,dumbledore,Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
943,harry,Ripped to pieces?
797,harry,I think she heard you.
608,hermione,I've read about those.
1007,harry,Ah- um.. Reading.
1630,dumbledore,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
262,hermione,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
1532,harry,"Well, you haven't finished it this time."
313,harry,The one who gave me this.
1585,hermione,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
918,harry,There's another.
858,harry,"Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her."
1692,dumbledore,"Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified."
712,harry,How long will it take to make?
1187,harry,I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
604,dumbledore,"She's not dead, Argus."
1124,dumbledore,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on."
717,harry,No.
312,harry,"He killed my parents, didn't he?"
876,harry,"Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!"
1344,harry,Sirius!
1297,harry,You okay?
752,hermione,"You will be able to, won't you?"
1139,harry,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
1358,hermione,"Headmaster, you've got to stop them."
1038,harry,"Good night, professor."
485,dumbledore,Thank you.
208,harry,Yeah. It should be great.
719,harry,"I mean, more than everyone else?"
1033,harry,Someone I know to be dead.
13,harry,Yes.
948,hermione,Rubbish.
660,dumbledore,Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
1167,harry,Then it'll be you!
856,harry,Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
11,harry,I will if she does.
300,dumbledore,"Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured."
645,snape,I've done the dungeons.
290,dumbledore,"Good luck, professor."
1565,dumbledore,"And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. "
1002,snape,"Well, well. Lupin."
812,dumbledore,"It is as we feared, Minerva"
1375,dumbledore,"You know the laws, Miss Granger"
1125,dumbledore,All right. It'll be all right.
63,harry,...watching people press their ugly faces in on you.
1558,harry,"I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it."
652,dumbledore,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
430,hermione,Oculus Reparo.
1563,harry,I want to go with you.
1616,dumbledore,It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
1221,snape,But why deny the dementors?
1070,hermione,"Look at you, playing with your cards."
1354,harry,And Hermione had the mirror.
264,harry,It's great to see you too.
1417,hermione,Remember what Dumbledore said?
605,dumbledore,She has been Petrified.
1556,dumbledore,"And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
1362,harry,It all fits.
944,harry,What are you talking about?
441,hermione,Just there.
400,snape,the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
1180,hermione,"And all this time, you've been his friend."
940,hermione,Beautiful day.
1507,hermione,And now we wait.
988,harry,My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
1504,harry,"Give me my wand, Tom."
350,hermione,I've been here all this time.
311,harry,Fortuna Major.
103,harry,It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
1153,hermione,"Oh, I'm sorry."
402,dumbledore,They are not.
1267,harry,Shush!
1525,harry,"And you framed him, didn't you?"
576,harry,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
586,snape,Pity.
1319,harry,"Come on, move faster!"
8,harry,If I could only let out for an hour or two
194,harry,Yes.
1230,dumbledore,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
1088,hermione,We'll stay with you too.
322,harry,Maybe if you wrote it down?
216,harry,"All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
1097,hermione,Follow me!
656,hermione,"Harry, no way!"
1634,harry,Lumos.
830,hermione,Swish and flick!
1389,harry,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
1528,harry,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
1457,hermione,"Come on. Come on, Buckbeak."
423,hermione,The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
1578,harry,Of course.
580,snape,"Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
1597,dumbledore,And second I sense that something is troubling you.
1506,harry,We've got to go. We've got to save her.
771,harry,Everyone?
367,harry,Muggles?
658,hermione,"Besides, you don't even know how to fly."
598,snape,And Gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek.
296,hermione,Just forget it.
117,harry,How did he escape?
376,harry,Could you tell me how to...?
1092,dumbledore,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
794,harry,Stop it!
60,harry,Your family?
68,harry,What terrible things? 
1035,harry,Look in properly. Go on. 
686,snape,Five points from Gryffindor.
662,harry,"Excuse me, sir."
271,harry,Thank you. Bye.
1688,harry,We had loads of help from you.
1054,harry,Are you okay?
1309,harry,Let's go!
966,hermione,I've already got mine.
1136,harry,Wait!
587,harry,It's Mrs. Norris.
1537,hermione,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
73,harry,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
934,harry,Seeing their faces.
386,harry,So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...
1361,harry,Spiders flee before it.
1605,dumbledore,"If I'm not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
964,harry,Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
1455,harry,"Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
885,hermione,"No, they can't."
1053,harry,We better take this back.
9,harry,Nothing. School stuff
789,hermione,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
1320,harry,Come on! Go!
589,harry,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
985,harry,I was sleepwalking.
246,harry, No. Please...
315,harry,Fortuna Major.
136,harry,Hedwig.
915,harry,No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
1205,dumbledore,"I wonder, could we...?"
174,hermione,"Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
624,snape,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
1277,harry,I know what he is.
1050,harry,We've got loads to tell you.
1362,dumbledore,Scabbers?
218,harry,Voldemort.
1553,dumbledore,"In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. "
710,hermione,But it's tricky. 
1311,harry,Go!
1650,harry,Mr. Malfoy!
489,hermione,"Oh, no. Okay, relax."
674,hermione,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
1276,harry,"You're Aragog, aren't you?"
1628,dumbledore,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
248,harry,I gotta tell you something.
198,harry,Everything.
1497,harry,Are you a ghost?
1500,harry,"Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up."
7,harry,Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
498,harry,"Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine."
1057,hermione,Look at my face.
88,harry,"One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic."
590,snape,Silence.
0,harry,Lumos Maxima...
705,harry,"Oh, brilliant."
601,dumbledore,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
356,harry,Platform 9 3/4?
615,harry,That's odd. 
270,hermione,"Okay, bye."
769,harry,So you mean this map shows...
1552,hermione,You're dying both of you.
1473,harry,"Ron! Ron, are you okay?"
847,hermione,Do you think he's all right?
1470,dumbledore,Over there.
272,hermione,"Come on, everyone's been so worried."
1299,hermione,That looks really painful.
699,hermione,"Mind you, it would be difficult."
59,harry,He's asleep!
691,hermione,"But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
1606,harry,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
1508,hermione,At least someone's enjoying himself.
429,hermione,For example:
736,harry,Thank you.
1383,dumbledore,Good luck.
10,harry,But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer.
778,harry,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
1451,harry,All right. Let's go.
304,dumbledore,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
1534,hermione,Saving your life.
80,harry,Anywhere is better than here.
1330,harry,We know one thing.
605,harry,Haunted building in Britain. I know.
1332,harry,Expelliarmus!
1624,harry,The family you serve is the Malfoys.
807,dumbledore,Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
352,harry,"Ron, I should tell you most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
374,harry,"Up! Ron, mind that tree!"
901,harry,Expecto Patronum!
632,dumbledore,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
409,hermione,Say hello to Buckbeak.
1569,dumbledore,"Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. "
1593,dumbledore,I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
1216,dumbledore,"I want it understood, Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence."
484,hermione,Immobulus!
551,harry,Didn't you hear it?
1576,hermione,"Come on, Harry."
1546,dumbledore,Mm. Alas. Earwax.
1567,dumbledore,"And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. "
1029,harry,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
973,harry,Wingardium Leviosa.
1224,snape,"Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like."
523,harry,What's a Mudblood?
797,harry,Who's doing it now?
1580,harry,Thanks.
1321,harry,Get us in the air.
28,dumbledore,Good luck...Harry Potter.
314,harry,"You know, Hagrid. "
872,snape,"Don't move, Potter."
190,harry,Mrs. Weasley.
1366,harry,Hermione's answered that too.
1673,harry,Never try to save my life again.
1368,harry,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
659,dumbledore,"For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own."
207,harry,First year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand.
69,harry,Was it nice there?
710,hermione,"No one blames you, Harry."
1415,harry,You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
1154,hermione,Nobody else knows our password.
1578,dumbledore,Well?
343,harry,Lost control of the trolley.
636,hermione,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear..."
805,dumbledore," Everyone will please, not panic. "
1426,harry,To ask you how you died.
526,hermione,Someone with non-magic parents.
192,harry,Good to see you too.
931,dumbledore,And about time too.
479,hermione,Get off me!
126,harry,Let go of me!
385,hermione,Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
1354,harry,They're gonna kill him?
1510,harry,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
1520,harry,Dead. I know.
708,harry,Let's go this way.
1343,harry,"Ron, this is it."
1550,harry,He will come.
266,hermione,Oculus Reparo.
1355,harry,I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
3,dumbledore,"I'm afraid so, professor."
233,harry,"Oh, nice to meet you."
1618,harry,What are you talking about?
170,harry,You knew? 
925,harry,Expecto Patronum!
217,harry,Can we find all this in London?
1356,hermione,Much worse.
1384,snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
1531,dumbledore,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. "
1345,harry,That's why I can hear it speak.
482,dumbledore,I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.
1501,harry,"You've got to help me, Tom."
1449,harry,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. "
302,dumbledore,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
1076,harry,"""Tom Marvolo Riddle."""
703,harry,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
881,harry,I'm sure.
65,harry,"It's just, I've never talked to a snake before."
1332,harry,He was innocent.
86,harry,I didn't do it on purpose.
1633,hermione,"How fast is it, Harry?"
704,hermione,How are you feeling?
732,hermione,Let's go.
1455,dumbledore,It's such a very long name...
1438,harry,"This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
1443,hermione,I thought I just saw… Never mind.
1434,hermione,Fudge is coming.
64,harry,Can you hear me?
1693,dumbledore,"Also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled."
1375,hermione,That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!
1580,harry,"Thanks, Hagrid. "
852,snape,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor."
591,snape,"Put your hand down, you silly girl!"
1088,harry,"Hello, can you hear me?"
408,dumbledore,"However, as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
1061,harry,What's this?
800,harry,"No, Dobby. Tell me."
1512,harry,But why?
581,snape,"You don't know? Well, let's try again."
1130,harry,Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
391,harry,The what?
1579,harry,Phoenix tears have healing powers.
1539,harry,Why do you care how I escaped?
1091,harry,Dumbledore?
1007,harry,"It just said, ""Use it well."""
873,snape,I'll get rid of it for you.
1568,harry,Ginny?
1198,harry,Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
419,hermione,Has anyone seen a toad?
670,snape,Quiet.
527,hermione,Someone like me.
1540,harry,Voldemort was after your time.
651,harry,"Give it here, Malfoy."
895,harry,How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
1623,harry,So this is your master.
1115,dumbledore,Good evening.
1145,hermione,Ron!!
688,harry,It's Quidditch tomorrow.
6,dumbledore,Hagrid is bringing him.
422,hermione,It's also quite dangerous. 
1051,hermione,Go away.
155,harry,Learnt what?
819,hermione,Maybe.
1401,hermione,This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
241,harry,"All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
299,dumbledore,"Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic "
280,harry,And did either of you two you know pass out?
1152,hermione,Harry!
167,harry,"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
198,harry,Floo powder?
213,harry,You'd like a dragon?
1097,hermione,I meant me!
1467,dumbledore,And all the strawberries.
718,harry,"Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?"
267,harry,I definitely need to remember that one.
1510,harry,Hermione?
1564,dumbledore,"Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. "
133,harry,"Make a wish, Harry."
408,hermione,Tah- tah- tah- dah! Isn't he beautiful?
1396,harry,That's us.
578,snape,Mr. Potter.
916,harry,Professor I swear I didn't.
711,hermione,I've never seen a more complicated potion.
171,harry,You knew all along and you never told me?
252,hermione,"But they'll catch Black, won't they?"
1147,harry,Ron. Ron.
1280,harry,They think it's Hagrid.
1543,harry,You're Voldemort.
784,harry,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
1409,harry,After all you did in your books?
378,harry,Be thankful it's not your neck.
935,harry,They were talking to me.
2,harry,Lumos Maxima...
1046,harry,Hair!
1005,snape,That remains to be seen.
1493,harry,Tom. Tom Riddle.
1406,harry,Good punch.
1545,harry,Any minute now.
145,harry,"No, thank you. Minister?"
1524,harry,Hagrid's my friend.
1349,harry,"Not directly, at least."
1279,harry,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks."
128,harry,Get off!
729,hermione,You could hit Harry.
1155,hermione,Where do you suppose this goes?
307,dumbledore,"But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."
1515,hermione,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
1502,hermione,No idea.
22,harry,"I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist."
810,dumbledore,The truth.
1150,harry,Move!
1484,hermione,Buckbeak.
1596,dumbledore,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
995,harry,Come on.
1567,harry,But you're innocent.
715,harry,"But, Hermione,"
692,harry,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione."
653,snape,You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
1036,harry,Stand there. There. 
902,harry,Expecto... Expecto...Expect...
1412,hermione,That felt good.
934,dumbledore,"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry."
381,harry,"Come on, go! Fast!"
317,harry,Thank you.
1257,harry,Come on.
1302,hermione,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
738,harry,No. I think my arm is broken.
1158,harry,Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
963,hermione,And then?
989,harry,Excellent.
1055,harry,Fine. See you later.
157,harry,I'm a what?
1296,hermione,"You go, I'll stay."
1341,snape,"There you are, Potter!"
877,harry,"When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
956,hermione,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
504,hermione,They got in on pure talent.
1370,harry,What if she never left?
1544,dumbledore,"I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. "
1312,harry,"Alive, you're free."
260,harry,I don't know.
657,hermione,You heard what Madam Hooch said.
482,hermione,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
682,snape,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy."
1392,harry,"Hermione! Hermione, wait."
123,harry,Ahh- ahh!
169,hermione,What do you expect?
1132,hermione,It just can't be.
775,harry,"You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or I might strangle you."
1533,harry,What are you doing?
951,dumbledore,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you."
872,hermione,"Harry, what happened?"
658,dumbledore,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep."
1282,harry,"After that, the dementors can have you."
1348,harry,I saw my dad.
1420,harry,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
433,hermione,I'm Hermione Granger.
1367,hermione,"The point is, we know the truth."
994,hermione,Just go. You're wasting time.
978,hermione,Add the hairs.
496,hermione,No one knows.
238,harry,Goodbye.
1454,harry,"Thanks, Myrtle."
575,harry,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
1472,dumbledore,Over there.
1299,harry,We'll just go.
817,hermione,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
301,dumbledore,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
982,hermione,Me too.
342,harry,Sorry.
750,harry,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
881,hermione,You can talk to snakes.
1534,harry,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
1505,hermione,And Snape's coming.
1161,hermione,Ron. You're okay.
1182,hermione,That's why he's been missing classes.
937,dumbledore,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes."
1635,dumbledore,Yes.
1339,hermione,Professor? Professor Lupin?
161,harry,I mean...l can't be a wizard.
500,hermione,That's what makes them so...
1353,hermione,Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
582,snape,"Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
1205,snape,Expelliarmus!
1099,harry,Hagrid!
596,snape,Well...
357,harry,"But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake."
567,harry,Did you hear it?
580,harry,I did think of Voldemort at first.
1381,snape,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. "
883,harry,Once. But so what?
1495,harry,She's not...?
1079,harry,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
984,snape,What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
1049,harry,"Hermione, come out."
265,hermione,What did you do to your glasses?
1395,harry,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber."
25,dumbledore,Until he's ready.
1645,harry,Don't worry. I will be.
1065,harry,Why would I throw something at you?
1052,harry,Hang on.
1044,harry,Calm down.
375,harry,Excuse me.
476,harry,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
70,harry,Do you miss your family?
1382,dumbledore,"When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin."
1461,dumbledore,"Now, look there."
1431,hermione,"If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad."
992,hermione,You go on without me.
1261,harry,You heard what Hagrid said.
309,harry,He was nothing more than a murderer.
904,harry,I can't be.
203,harry,Okay.
1096,harry,I read it on the train that day.
127,harry,They're my letters!
698,hermione,It's in your blood.
1060,harry,Sorry?
624,dumbledore,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
1243,dumbledore,However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
1429,hermione,"Yes, and you must!"
737,hermione,Are you okay?
631,dumbledore,Keep moving!
1628,harry,But who sent it?
630,dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus."
1608,harry,So the Sorting Hat was right.
1516,hermione,According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
1617,dumbledore,It is our choices.
153,harry,"Sorry, no."
1209,snape,I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
149,harry,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
426,hermione,Are you sure that's a real spell?
625,harry,When I said I wasn't hungry.
385,harry,"See you, Hedwig."
932,dumbledore,He's been looking dreadful for days.
1487,dumbledore,You've been with us all the time.
1447,dumbledore,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
1486,dumbledore,"Afterall, How could you?"
1390,hermione,Come on. And we can't be seen.
76,harry,Yeah? Try me.
577,hermione,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
239,hermione,Come on. Everywhere else is full
1341,harry,Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
7,harry,But she’s bored! 
1549,harry,"Don't worry, he will."
393,snape,Do you have any idea how serious this is?
764,harry,No. Is that really...?
261,hermione,Harry. Hagrid.
1649,harry,Mr. Malfoy.
684,snape,Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
1337,harry,Ron...
593,snape,Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.
395,snape,Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.
1031,harry,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works."
1008,harry,Famous fire eaters...
1343,snape,"Come back here, Potter!"
1137,hermione,"Look, Hagrid's our friend. "
959,hermione,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
1183,harry,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron."
1418,hermione,"If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared."
1378,dumbledore,"If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss."
765,harry,It was you. 
116,harry,Because there's no post on Sundays?
1370,dumbledore,But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
1509,harry,Yeah.
681,hermione,All the teachers are.
1111,dumbledore,That's ling you see over there...
730,harry,You could teach me.
1127,harry,What?
1072,hermione,We've got final exams coming up soon.
638,harry,Do you think I should have told them?
1540,harry,Sirius. Come on!
1316,harry,Get us out of here.
1331,harry,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
733,harry,But you made it go away.
945,hermione,Ronald has lost his rat.
1387,harry,Where's Ron?
930,harry,He just caught fire.
1419,hermione,Let's go.
1179,hermione,No! I trusted you!
1353,harry,"But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again."
1538,hermione,That was so scary.
1108,harry,Hagrid.
255,harry,"Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
991,hermione,I...I don't think I'm going.
1281,harry,I said we'd take you to the castle.
1050,harry,No.
1381,dumbledore,"Oh, and by the way."
1411,harry,You wrote them.
528,hermione,It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
1456,harry,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?"
1133,hermione,Ron. Ron!
415,harry,Just a little bit.
378,hermione,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline."
1143,harry,"Ron! Ron, wait!"
846,snape,Expelliarmus!
404,harry,Professor McGonagall.
796,harry,Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?
1131,hermione,It can't be Hagrid.
539,hermione,How can you be nearly headless?
718,hermione,But it's the only plan we've got.
1544,harry,He'll conjure the Patronus.
